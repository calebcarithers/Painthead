Online exhibition framed as a social analysis on the users own comfort within the space they are viewing the work, while delivering a personal interjection on identity. Is the user willing to raise their voice to an unusual volume in the space they are in? Are users less willing to do this because of social judgment from those are around (if they are not along), or are they themselves uncomfortable to bring their voice to such a level even if they are alone. In addition to this interjection of sociality and self comfort I point the user through a personal confrontation: WHO AM I. A frustrating experience of questioning identity (which incites me to **YELL**. I present the user items and experiences which I believe have shaped me thus far. If the user screams loud enough they will discover words amongst my personal digital portrait which form a sentence encapsulating the nature of the project.
